Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git init will make a repository  out of the current directory and sub-folders.  No commits have yet been made, therefore, git status shows a fatal error, "your current branch 'master' does not have any commits yet".  Initialize Git then make your first commit to solve error.

Q2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you add, remove, and get status for your current working directory before making the initial commit and following commits.
